dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (BSIT) at Eastern Visayas State University

Currently in my fourth year, I am passionate about exploring the dynamic world of technology and its applications. Aside from my academic pursuits, I have also been actively engaged as a freelancer for nearly three years. My expertise in C#, Python, Machine Learning Language, Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), where I have gained valuable experience in various stages of software development, including requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment. This hands-on experience has allowed me to enhance my technical skills and develop a keen understanding of the industry standards and best practices.

As a freelancer, I have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, collaborating with clients to deliver efficient and high-quality solutions. This experience has not only sharpened my problem-solving abilities but has also fostered my creativity and adaptability in tackling different challenges.

With a strong foundation in my studies and practical experience as a freelancer, I am enthusiastic about further honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in the field of IT. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to contribute my specialization, learn from professionals, and make a positive impact in the ever-evolving world of technology.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me. I am excited to embark on this journey and explore new possibilities in the realm of IT.
